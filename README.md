# 👁️ AI-Driven Digital Eye Strain Detection

AI-Driven Digital Eye Strain Detection is a mobile-based solution developed to detect symptoms of Digital Eye Strain (DES) such as  redness, conjunctiva, cataract, uveitis and drowsiness using advanced computer vision and machine learning technologies. The system provides real-time analysis and personalized break recommendations to promote healthier digital habits. Built with React Native, YOLO and TensorFlow this project represents an innovative step toward enhancing user well-being during prolonged digital device usage.

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository follows the GitHub Flow branching model with the following branches:

main: Contains the stable, production-ready code.

development: The active development branch where new features, fixes, and improvements are integrated.

feature/: Developers should create feature branches off of development, work on them, and submit pull requests before merging changes back into development.

## 🚀 Features

Real-Time Symptom Detection: Detect eye redness, conjunctiva, cataract, uveitis and drowsiness using mobile cameras.

Personalized Break Recommendations: Offer customized breaks based on real-time symptoms and user feedback.

Multi-Platform Support: Built with React Native to run seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.

Advanced AI Models: Incorporates YOLO for object detection, CNNs for feature extraction, and TensorFlow/Keras, Vision Transformer for personalized analysis.

Gamification and Engagement: Includes wellness streaks and motivational features to encourage healthy digital device habits.

Data Security: User data is encrypted and securely managed using Firebase and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
